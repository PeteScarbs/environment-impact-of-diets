# environment-impact-of-diets
This repository contains the code used for analysis in the paper Scarborough P, Clark M, Cobiac LJ, Papier K, Knuppel A, Lynch J, Harrington RA, Key T, Springmann M. Vegans, vegetarians, fish-eaters and meat-eaters in the UK show discrepant environmental impacts. Nature Food, 2023.

The analysis combines data from 1000 iterations of a Monte Carlo analysis. Each iteration produces an estimate of the greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, eutrophication and biodiversity impact of six diet groups in the UK. The six diet groups are: vegans, vegetarians, fish-eaters, low meat eaters (<50g/d); medium meat eaters (50-100g/d); high meat eaters (>100g/d).

Each iteration combines data on the environmental impact of diets drawn from a review of 570 life cycle analyses covering results from over 38,000 farms in 119 countries covering five continents. Combining the iterations provides an estimate of the average impact for each diet group, and an uncertainty range representing variation due to different methods of food production and sourcing.
